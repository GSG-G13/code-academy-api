# Users journey
### As an Admin: 
As an Admin, besides the Users what they can do, I will add users who are accepted in the CodeAcademy program, by their emails as Users, delete, and give roles.
 When Users add a post, I can delete the post or any annoying comments.
I can manage Users status if he is still training, available, or getting hired. I can also add notes about someone in the current cohort so that just Admin can see them.
If someone wants to add a new topic to the curriculum, I will approve it or ignore it.

### As a G-Student: 
As a G-Member, I can access the resources whenever I want, and communicate with my colleagues in the current cohort and prep cohorts, and later cohorts. I have a profile containing my information like name, email, LinkedIn, discord...etc.
adding posts so that other users can interact with them.
I can add an article as a new topic in the curriculum, and the Admin approves it or ignores it.
